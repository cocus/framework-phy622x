# PHY622X MCU Firmware Package

This is a re-implementation of PhyPlus' SDK, aiming to be aligned to the **HAL** libraries from STM.

This codebase provides a PlatformIO framework, but it also works standalone.

## Standalone usage

See `Makefile`, where the `examples/simple_no_platformio/main.c` is compiled against the same source that PlatformIO would.

## Release note

Nothing for now.

## Boards available

This code should work as-is on most PhyPlus boards, including the cheap "smartwatches" that are a scam.

## Troubleshooting

You're mostly on your own, but feel free to open an issue if you have any comments.
